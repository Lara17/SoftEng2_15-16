\section{Classes Analyzed}
\subsection{Class Name and Location}
	The only class assigned to our group is \ttfamily Registered Resources \normalfont located in \ttfamily appserver/transaction/jts/src/main/java/com/sun/jts/CosTransactions \normalfont package.
	
	In particular, we have assigned the \ttfamily distributeCommit() \normalfont method.
	
\subsection{Class Functional Role}
	Thanks to the Javadoc and the code, we have understood that the class \ttfamily Registered Resources \normalfont , in which the method assigned to us is located, works with some entities, called "Resources", and it generates different types of message, that refer to those entities, while committing (assuming: saving somewhere) them; doing so it will catch any raised exception until no resources are left to commit.
