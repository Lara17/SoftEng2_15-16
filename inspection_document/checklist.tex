\section{Issues Checklist}
\subsection{Naming Convetions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Class name is prettu self-explanatory. It handles all the registered resources.
	
	Reading the Javadoc inside the class file adds mor information: this class handles some Resource Objects that are involved in a transaction. These objects are stored in a list together with their state relative to such transaction.
	
	Since an instance of this transaction can be accessed bt multiple threads, tha Javadoc suggest to use serialization in the implementation
	
	All the informations relative to an instance of this class should be reconstructible in case of system failure, so they are recorded.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Line 112: Resource called laoResource
		\item Line 774: boolean called rmErr, maybe removedError
		\item Line 901: int called i that correspond to the number of the current resource; used to loop but maybe it should be used a better name since it's not only a loop variable
		\item Line 1470: this method is the distribution of one phase commit, not the commit itself
	\end{itemize}
