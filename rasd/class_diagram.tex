Starting from the definition of the "City" class, we are been able to define the other classes, specifying the relations between them. Only the class "Booking" is an abstract one and it is extended by two other classes, "Short-term Reservation" and "Long-term Reservation".
We have written for the classes some private attributes, that are relevant, in our opinion. These attributes connect a class to another, with reference to the relations, defined before. 
We have omitted the classes methods because this Class Diagram lets us to have a first overview and because we will not implement this system.
