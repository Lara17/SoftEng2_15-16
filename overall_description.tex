\section{Overall description}
	\subsection{Product perspective}
		\emph{Whereas the system is too much little, considering its dimensions, we have consolidate the six subsections of the IEEE Std 830-1998}.

		In the case of web application, a user must have a computer to access to the service site. It's necessary also a browser to allow navigation. This application isn't a weak one and, so, it doesn't imply a heavy work of the primary memory. 
		Through the site, the user can update himself/herself about this service and, then he/she can book a taxi, for a short-term reservation or a long-term one. After that, he/she can modify his/her reservation or delete it.
		
		In the case of mobile application, a user must have a smart phone with an Internet connection to access to the service app. It's necessary that the cell phone has got sufficient memory to allow the installation of this app, that is compatible with all of the SOs (i.e. Android, iOS and Windows Phone).
		Through this user-friendly mobile application, the user can do the same stuffs, using the web application: in particular, he/she can book a taxi (always for a short-term or a long-term reservation), he/she can modify his/her reservation and he/she can delete it. 
	\subsection{Product functions}
		\paragraph{User side}The system allows the users to book a taxi using the website or the mobile application installed on their smart phones. They also can reserve a taxi but they must do it at least 2 hours before the chosen hour; in this case the system assigns a unique code for every reservation in order to allow users to modify or delete their reservation. The system also sends notification to the users about the status of their bookings and reservation or informations about waiting time for their ride.
		\paragraph{Taxi side}The system allows taxi to register into it in order to be added to the queue and be given new passengers. The system also sends notification to taxis about new jobs. It also allows taxis to notify users about delays.
