\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
	This document is the Project Plan of a system, called myTaxiService, used to manage  a taxi service in a city. The main goal of this document is to estimate the overall cost and define the risk of the project and system.
\subsection{Scope}
	The scope of this system is to manage taxis in a city. A town is divided in zone of 2 square kilometers and, for each zone, the system defines a queue, composed by the identifier, which is the vehicle plate, of free taxis in that specific zone. A user can require a taxi ride from a zone, but he/she can also book one for another moment, using the web application or the mobile one. Furthermore, about long-term reservations, after the user has created one, he/she is able to modify the date or the hour or both of his/her booking, and he/she can delete it.
