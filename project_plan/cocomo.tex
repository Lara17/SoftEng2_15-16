\section{COCOMO Approach}
	Considering to use JEE as programming language, to pass from FP to SLOC we can use the average convertion factor 46, as described at the site \emph{http://www.qsm.com/resources/function-point-languages-table}. 
	$$SLOC=UFP*ConvertionFactor$$
	$$SLOC=72*46=3312$$
	
	According to the table below, we have considered the underlined values in yellow for the scale drivers and the underlined values in green for the cost drivers.

	Considering only the scale drivers, we make the following addition:
	$$E=B + 0.01*(PREC+FLEX+RESL+TEAM+PMAT)$$ where B = 0.91 for COCOMO-II
	$$E=0.91+0.01*(3.72+2.03+4.24+3.29+4.68)=1.0896$$
	
	
	Considering only the cost drivers, we make the following moltiplication:
	$$EAF=RELY*DATA*CPLX*RUSE*DOCU*TIME*STOR*PVOL*ACAP*PCAP*PCON*APEX*PLEX*LTEX*TOOL*SITE*SCED$$
	$$EAF=1.10*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00*1.00=1.10$$
	
	So, now we can compute the effort, using the formula below:
	$$effort=2.94*EAF*(KSLOC)^E$$
	$effort=2.94*1.10*(3.312)^1.0896 = 11.92$ person/months
	
	\newline 
	Now we calculate the duration of the project in months, using the following formula:
	$$duration = C*(effort)^(D+0.2*(E-B))$$ where C = 3.67, D = 0.28, B = 0.91 for COCOMO-II
	$duration = 3.67*(11.92)^(0.31592) = 8.03$ months
	
	\newline
	The people needed to complete the project are calculated through the formula below:
	$$N_{people} = \ceil{effort/duration} $$
	$$N_{people} = \ceil{11.92/8.03} = \ceil{1.48} = 2$$
	
	Using the online tool {http://csse.usc.edu/tools/COCOMOII.php}, we give a more accurate estimation of the previous calculus. In the following images, we can see the results.
