\section{Tools and Test Equipment Required}
	To test our system we can use a tool like \textit{JUnit} to verify the behavior of the system submodules. This method should help to reduce the number of bugs in every module.
	
	To verify the behavior of every module we can use a tool like \textit{mockito}; in this way we can test the integration of every submodule.
	
	Once the system is fully tested using the tools above, the performance of the system can be analyzed using a software like \textit{Apache JMeter}; in this way an average loads or a stress test can be run to see how the system behaves in every situation.
