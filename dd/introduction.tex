\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
	This Document is the Design Document (DD) of a system, called myTaxiService, used to manage  a taxi service in a city. The main goals of this document are to specify how the system has to be build in terms of software and hardware architecture. In particular specifying how the software architecture is built and what kind of styles are used and which kind of tiered architecture is used for the hardware part.
