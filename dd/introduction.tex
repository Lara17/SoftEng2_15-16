\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
	This Document is the Design Document (DD) of a system, called myTaxiService, used to manage  a taxi service in a city. The main goals of this document are to specify how the system has to be build in terms of software and hardware architecture. In particular specifying how the software architecture is built and what kind of styles are used and which kind of tiered architecture is used for the hardware part.
\subsection{Scope}
	The scope of this system is to manage taxis in a city. A town is divided in zone of 2 square kilometers and, for each zone, the system defines a queue, composed by the identifier, which is the vehicle plate, of free taxis in that specific zone. A user can require a taxi ride from a zone, but can also book one for another moment, using the web application or the mobile one. About long-term reservations, the user can also, after have created one, modify the date or the hour or both of his/her booking, and he/she can delete it.

\subsection{Document Structure}
	This documents contains the schema that represent the software and hardware architecture, sequence diagrams that show how the system works and the design choices made to build the system. After that are present some implementation in pseudo code, user interfaces and how all the requirements present in the RASD map in this document.
