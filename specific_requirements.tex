	\subsection{Functional Requirements}
		\subsubsection{Booking a Taxi ride}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item First of all, the system checks the date and the hour of the reservation. 
		\item In case of long-term reservation:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item the system produces an alphanumeric code;
		\item the system stores this code, with name and surname of the user, in the relative database;
		\item the system assigns this code to the user.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item In case of short-term reservation:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item the system checks what is the address inserted by the user;
		\item the system checks in which zone of the city is that address, using the GPS information;
		\item the system controls the taxis queue of that zone;
		\item if the taxis queue contains at least the identifier of one taxi, the system sends a notification to the first taxi driver of the queue; when it will receive the confirm, the system tells the user that the reservation is been realized;
		\item if the taxis queue hasn't got any taxis identifiers, the system checks the queue of the four adjacent zones of that area; the system continues in this way as long as it finds an available taxi; and then it will do the same things of the previous point; when the system will receive the confirm, it tells the user that there will be a delay; if the user decides to accept, the system tells him/her that the reservation is been realized, otherwise not.
		\end{enumerate}
		\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Update a long-term reservation}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The system receives the alphanumeric code from the user.

	\subsection{The World and the Machine}
		\begin{center}

		\end{center}
		Service request and Taxi status are events that happen in the physical world; the machine then uses the data coming from the world to build a representation of it using taxi queue, taxi location and city zones. The database is only stored in the machine and contains all the data about users to send notification, long term reservations and data about taxis.
	\subsection{Scenarios}
		\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
		Bob has a meeting in Los Angeles the day after tomorrow. Since he hasn't a car, he decides to use myTaxiService and therefore rent a taxi to go to the airport. He grabs his cell phone and, with the mobile application of the service, he books a taxi. The app asks him his name, his surname, his phone number and the address where he wants to wait for the taxi. He inserts all the data requested and, after the server has stored these information in the database, with a SMS, it notifies Bob that the long-term reservation has been realized correctly. 
		The chosen day, ten minutes before the appointment, the system calls the first available taxi, searching it in the taxis queue of the zone in which there is the address specified by Bob. Unfortunately the first taxi doesn't answer the call; so the system puts him at the end of the queue and it calls the second taxi of the queue, which accepts the assignment. Then, Bob receives from the system, via SMS, a notification in which it was clarified that a taxi was coming to drive him to his destination.
		
		\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
		Today Francois starts his new job as a taxi driver. Yesterday morning, he signed up himself in myTaxiService application. Through his smart phone, he inserted only four information: his name, his surname, his email address and finally a password which he will use to sign in. After that, the system assigned him an alphanumeric code, that was the register of the taxi, which he will drive.
		During this morning, Francois signs in, inserting the username, that is the register of his taxi, and the password that he choose yesterday, during the registration. Clicking on the "Confirm" button, he accesses in the homepage of the mobile application. Francois has many possibilities to choose: he can view information about the current ride; he can view all the rides that he did in the past; he can send notifications of delay to the system and finally he can log out, of course at the end of the business day.
		While he is browsing the mobile application, Francois receives from the system a notification of a new ride. After the opening of this notification, Francois confirms the service and his business day starts.  
		
		\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
		Carl wants to go to visit one of his friends. Using the smart phone, he accesses to myTaxiService mobile application and he books a taxi, inserting name surname phone number and address, in the relative forms. The system stores these information in the database and then it checks in which zone there is the address specified by Carl. After that, the system notifies the first taxi in that zone's queue. The taxi receives a notification about that service by the system and he confirms the job, through the mobile application installed on his own smart phone. 
		Unfortunately a taxi's tyre runs flat; so the taxi driver sends a delay notification to the system, informing it that he can't complete the job. After the receive of this notification, therefore, the system puts that taxi at the end of the queue and it calls the second one that accepts the assignment. The system advises Carl, via SMS, that there will be a little delay.
		
		\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
		Thanks to one of his closest friends, Tizio has known a service, called MyTaxiService, that lets to book a taxi, through the web application or the user-friendly mobile one.
		Whereas his computer was broken, using his smart phone, first of all, Tizio has inserted his personal data, that were name, surname, phone number and home address. In that moment, the system has received the request of Tizio and it has checked in what zone of the city Tizio was asking for the service. In the taxis queue of that area, the system could have verify that there were no taxis. So it has become to check, starting from the zones near the area in which Tizio has requested a taxi, all the lists of available taxis. 
		Finally the system has found the only one taxi which, in that moment, was available. So the system has sent to Caio the notification of the new route. Besides Caio was standing, with his taxi, in a zone far from the place in which there was Tizio, he has confirmed the service, using the mobile application of his smart phone. After receiving the confirmation, the system has warned Tizio that the taxi would be arrived with a delay.
		About one hour later, Tizio is get into the Caio car and so, in a short time, he is arrived in the place where he would have meet his girlfriend Sempronia, relaxing himself, discovering that she was late more than him.
		
		\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
		Ann receives a call from one of her friend that tells her that her best friend has given birth to her son, Jimmy. Ann, due to the trains' strike decides to call myTaxiService to take her to the hospital to visit the newborn. So from her pc, she opens the web site of myTaxiService, that is www.mytaxiservice.com, clicks on the "Book" button to rent a taxi, after she has inserted all the needed data, that were name, surname, phone number and address, the system checks the taxis queue of the zone in which there is the address of Ann. Discovering that there is no available taxi in that zone in this specific time, the system searches for an available taxi in the queue of the adjacent zones. After it finds a free taxi in a nearby zone, the system notifies Ann, via SMS, that her reservation has been realized correctly but the taxi will arrive to Ann's address with a little delay. 
		
		\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
		Finally, today, Rossana would have taken the airplane. The flight was booked three days ago, but, because of bad weather, it was been deleted. So, she has accessed to the website of MyTaxiService to modify her reservation. She has used her notebook and then she has gone to the web page, concerning the modification/elimination of reservations. In the dedicated form, she has inserted the code that the system gave her to do this stuff, if she would have needed, but she could do it only until 15 minutes before the stipulated time. So she has postponed the reservation, without any problems.
		One hour before the meeting with the taxi, she has received a call from her boyfriend Heric, who wasn't really enthusiastic about her decision to go to USA for the Erasmus. When he has known that Rossana hasn't left yet, Heric has decided to give her a ride to the airport. So the girl, for that moment using her smart phone (the computer was in the luggage), has accessed to the mobile application of MyTaxiService to delete definitely her reservation. Going again in the dedicated page and then inserting her code in the specific form (but now choosing the "Elimination"), she has confirmed the cancellation of the reservation.
