\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose - Description of the Problem}
	This document is the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) of a system used to manage a taxi service in a city called myTaxiService. The main goal of this document is to describe the system in terms of functional and non-funcional requirements, specify the requirements and the costrains and to specify how the system will beheave in its application once that it is deployed. This document is meant to be read by the developers of the software but also by the customer to be sure that all what he asks is well defined and corresponds to what is going to be developed; this document hence can be used as a contract between the customer and the developers.
		
	\subsection{Scope - Goals}
	The scope of the system is to manage taxis around the city. The city is divided in zone of 2square kilometers and for each zone the system define a queue based on the free taxis in that specific zone. A user can require a taxi ride from a zone, but can also book one for another moment.
	
	\subsection{Actors}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Users: users can request a taxi ride or book one using the mobile app or the website.
		\item Taxis: taxis work for a taxi company and provide the service to the users by transporting them to their destination.
	\end{itemize}
